# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance improvements made to the VZ Dolci frontend application.

## Summary

A comprehensive performance audit was conducted, identifying and fixing multiple performance bottlenecks that were causing unnecessary re-renders and redundant calculations throughout the application.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. CartContext - Memoized Computed Values

**Problem**: `getTotal()` and `getItemCount()` were functions that recalculated values on every invocation, even when the cart hadn't changed.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced function-based getters with `useMemo` hooks that compute values only when the cart changes
- Changed from `getTotal()` → `total` and `getItemCount()` → `itemCount`

**Files Changed**:
- `src/application/contexts/CartContext.jsx`
- `src/presentation/components/common/Header.jsx`
- `src/presentation/components/common/SideCart.jsx`
- `src/presentation/pages/CheckoutPage.jsx`

**Impact**: Eliminated redundant array reduce operations on every render.

### 2. CartContext - Memoized Context Value

**Problem**: The context value object was recreated on every render, causing all context consumers to re-render unnecessarily.

**Solution**: Wrapped the context value object in `useMemo` to maintain referential equality when dependencies haven't changed.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/application/contexts/CartContext.jsx`

**Impact**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of all components consuming CartContext.

### 3. Component Memoization

**Problem**: Presentational components were re-rendering even when their props hadn't changed.

**Solution**: Added `React.memo` to pure components:
- `ProductCard` - Prevents re-render when other products change
- `FAQItem` - Prevents re-render when other FAQ items toggle
- `ProductList` - Prevents re-render on unrelated state changes

**Files Changed**:
- `src/presentation/components/features/Products/ProductCard.jsx`
- `src/presentation/components/features/Products/ProductList.jsx`
- `src/presentation/components/features/FAQ/FAQItem.jsx`

**Impact**: Significant reduction in React component tree reconciliation work.

### 4. ProductsRepository - Singleton Pattern

**Problem**: A new `ProductsRepository` instance was created every time `useProducts` was called, recreating product entities unnecessarily.

**Solution**: Implemented singleton pattern - export a single instance instead of the class.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/infrastructure/repositories/ProductsRepository.js`
- `src/application/hooks/useProducts.js`

**Impact**: Eliminated redundant object creation and improved memory efficiency.

### 5. Static Data Extraction

**Problem**: FAQ data array was recreated on every render of `FAQPage`.

**Solution**: Moved the FAQ data constant outside the component.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/presentation/pages/FAQPage.jsx`

**Impact**: Prevents array recreation on every render.

### 6. Event Handler Memoization

**Problem**: Event handlers in `CheckoutPage` were recreated on every render.

**Solution**: Wrapped handlers with `useCallback`:
- `handleQuantityChange`
- `handleRemove`
- `generateWhatsAppMessage`

**Files Changed**:
- `src/presentation/pages/CheckoutPage.jsx`

**Impact**: Stable function references prevent child component re-renders.

### 7. Header Optimization

**Problem**: `getItemCount()` was called twice in a single render - once for the conditional and once for display.

**Solution**: Store the count in a variable and reuse it.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/presentation/components/common/Header.jsx`

**Impact**: Eliminated redundant function call.

### 8. Component Display Names

**Problem**: `SideCart` component had no display name, making debugging harder.

**Solution**: Added proper function name to `forwardRef`.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/presentation/components/common/SideCart.jsx`

**Impact**: Better React DevTools experience.

## Measurement

### Before Optimizations
- Unnecessary re-renders on cart updates
- Multiple reduce operations per render
- Component tree reconciliation for unchanged components
- New object allocations on every render

### After Optimizations
- Memoized calculations run only when dependencies change
- Components skip re-render when props are unchanged
- Stable function references prevent callback recreation
- Singleton pattern reduces memory allocations

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Memoization**: Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
2. **Callback Stability**: Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to child components
3. **Component Memoization**: Use `React.memo` for pure presentational components
4. **Singleton Pattern**: Reuse instances where appropriate
5. **Static Data**: Define constants outside components
6. **Context Optimization**: Memoize context value objects

## Future Recommendations

1. **Code Splitting**: Implement lazy loading for routes
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: If product list grows significantly
3. **Image Optimization**: Add lazy loading and optimization when real images are added
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add React Profiler in development
6. **Web Vitals**: Monitor Core Web Vitals in production

## Testing

All changes have been:
- ✅ Built successfully with Vite
- ✅ Reviewed for code quality
- ✅ Scanned for security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Verified for backward compatibility

## Notes

- All optimizations maintain the existing component APIs
- No breaking changes introduced
- Existing ESLint prop-types warnings are unrelated to these optimizations
